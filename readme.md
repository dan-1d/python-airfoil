# Overview

Convert airfoil .dat files to a variety of useful formats. Currently, this conversion is to dxf and svg using the libraries: ezdxf and svgwrite.

The dat file input should be text, with space-separated pairs of floating point coordinates describing the surface (outer perimeter) of the airfoil shape.

The only file required from this project is "airfoil_dat_to_dxf.py"  although this may change in the future. THe other directory is a fork of similar material on Github that did not work well for me.
